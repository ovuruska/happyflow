## Getting Started

HappyFlow aims to simplify the project setup process by generating tailored project templates based on your responses to a series of prompts.

## Installation

HappyFlow is a NodeJS based CLI tool. Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed in your environment.

To install HappyFlow globally on your machine, simply run:

```bash
npm install -g happyflow
```

## Usage

After successful installation, you can start a new project using HappyFlow by entering the following command:

```bash

```

This will start a prompt asking you to explain your project in a few words, for example:

```bash
? Explain your program in a few words:

```

Based on your input, HappyFlow will generate a relevant project structure to get you started!
